# Christmas Dinner Scheduling

Using knowledge learnt during the COMP70068 Scheduling and Resource Allocation module, this mini-project aimed to create a schedule for cooking Christmas dinner.

The items listed for Christmas Dinner 2023 are in the file [ChristmasDinner2023.py](./Problems/ChristmasDinner2023.py)

## Features

- Schedules items to reduce the total time spent outside the cooking appliances, to reduce the total amount of cool down.
- Only schedules items that are cooked at roughly the same temperature by checking for a maximum temperature difference.

## Future Improvements

- Add file parsing to allow for the definition of items for each year.
- Schedule in rest times that do not require the appliance, but will finish resting at the serve time.
